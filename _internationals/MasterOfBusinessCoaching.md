The Master of Business Coaching is a 2-years program divided into four semesters providing students with conceptual frameworks reflecting a cognitive, psycho-dynamic and systemic-narrative approach. The education is anchored within both philosophical and psychological thinking. The MBC develops the studentâ€™s coaching capabilities in order to handle a variety of business related issues. We are facilitating a learning environment where students are developing skills in order to take on the responsibility of serving employees and leaders with coaching.

 We are developing their capacity of having important dialogues, their self-esteem and their cognitive skills. The education has an accreditation from EMCC and thereby valid in whole Europe.

CCC now offers an International Master of Business Coaching starting out end of September 2019 in Copenhagen. The teaching is carried out in English.

The price is 6.000 Euros pr. semester.
