The Master of Business Coaching is a 2-years program divided into four semesters providing students with conceptual frameworks reflecting a cognitive, psycho-dynamic and systemic-narrative approach. The education is anchored within both philosophical and psychological thinking. The MBC develops the student’s coaching capabilities in order to handle a variety of business related issues. We are facilitating a learning environment where students are developing skills in order to take on the responsibility of serving employees and leaders with coaching.
